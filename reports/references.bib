In the light of these reflections we have proposed the {BRIDGE} guidelines for the conduct of fair global health epidemiology, targeted at stakeholders involved in the commissioning, conduct, appraisal and publication of global health research. The guidelines follow the conduct of a study chronologically from the early stages of study preparation until the dissemination and communication of findings. They can be used as a checklist by research teams, funders and other stakeholders to ensure that a study is conducted in line with both research integrity and research fairness principles. In this paper we offer a detailed explanation for each item of the {BRIDGE} guidelines.

	abstract = {Background Research integrity and research fairness have gained considerable momentum in the past decade and have direct implications for global health epidemiology. Research integrity and research fairness principles should be equally nurtured to produce high-quality impactful research—but bridging the two can lead to practical and ethical dilemmas. In order to provide practical guidance to researchers and epidemiologist, we set out to develop good epidemiological practice guidelines specifically for global health epidemiology, targeted at stakeholders involved in the commissioning, conduct, appraisal and publication of global health research.
Methods We developed preliminary guidelines based on targeted online searches on existing best practices for epidemiological studies and sought to align these with key elements of global health research and research fairness. We validated these guidelines through a Delphi consultation study, to reach a consensus among a wide representation of stakeholders.
Results A total of 45 experts provided input on the first round of e-Delphi consultation and 40 in the second. Respondents covered a range of organisations (including for example academia, ministries, {NGOs}, research funders, technical agencies) involved in epidemiological studies from countries around the world (Europe: 19; Africa: 10; North America: 7; Asia: 5; South-America: 3 Australia: 1). A selection of eight experts were invited for a face-to-face meeting. The final guidelines consist of a set of 6 standards and 42 accompanying criteria including study preparation, protocol development, data collection, data management, data analysis, dissemination and communication.
Conclusion While guidelines will not by themselves guard global health from questionable and unfair research practices, they are certainly part of a concerted effort to ensure not only mutual accountability between individual researchers, their institutions and their funders but most importantly their joint accountability towards the communities they study and society at large.},

	shorttitle = {Towards fair and effective North–South collaboration},
	abstract = {Background: At the turn of the 90s, studies showed that health research contributed little to health and development in low- and middle-income countries because it was oriented towards international priorities and dominated by researchers from the North. A new approach to North–South collaboration was required that would support demand-driven and locally led research in the South. The aim of this study was to analyse the development and functioning of a programme for demand-driven and locally led research in Ghana that was supported by a North–South collaboration.
Methods: For this mixed-method case study, we combined document analysis, key informant interviews and observation of programme events.
Results: The development of the research programme started with constructing a sponsorship constellation in the Netherlands. After highlighting the problems with traditional research collaboration, an advisory council formulated a vision for a more equal and effective approach to North–South collaboration. Together with Ghanaian partners, this vision was turned into a proposal for a Ghanaian-led programme for demand-driven and locally led research, which was funded by the Netherlands government. Research priority setting showed that the Ghanaian research needs were very different from the priorities of foreign funders and researchers. After a slow start, the number of locally submitted proposals increased from 13 in 2001 to 94 in 2005, revealing the existence of a substantial, but partly latent reservoir of research capacity. In total, 79 studies were funded. An impact evaluation showed that the results of the majority of the studies were used to contribute to action. Despite its success, the research programme came to an end in 2008 after the sponsorship constellation in the Netherlands fell apart.
Conclusion: Our study shows that realising a programme for demand-driven and locally led research in the South provides an effective approach to North–South collaboration in which results are used and local capacities and institutions are strengthened.},

	abstract = {Introduction and method Africa is currently host to a number of international genomics research and biobanking consortia, each with a mandate to advance genomics research and biobanking in Africa. Whilst most of these consortia promise to transform the way international health research is done in Africa, few have articulated exactly how they propose to go about this. In this paper, we report on a qualitative interviewing study in which we involved 17 genomics researchers in Africa. We describe their perceptions and expectations of international genomics research and biobanking initiatives in Africa.
Results All interviewees were of the view that externally funded genomics research and biobanking initiatives in Africa, have played a critical role in building capacity for genomics research and biobanking in Africa and in providing an opportunity for researchers in Africa to collaborate and network with other researchers. Whilst the opportunity to collaborate was seen as a benefit, some interviewees stressed the importance of recognizing that these collaborations carry mutual benefits for all partners, including their collaborators in {HICs}. They also voiced two major concerns of being part of these collaborative initiatives: the possibility of exploitation of African researchers and the non-sustainability of research capacity building efforts. As a way of minimising exploitation, researchers in Africa recommended that genuine efforts be made to create transparent and equitable international health research partnerships. They suggested that this could be achieved through,: having rules of engagement, enabling African researchers to contribute to the design and conduct of international health projects in Africa, and mutual and respectful exchange of experience and capacity between research collaborators. These were identified as hallmarks to equitable international health research collaborations in Africa.
Conclusion Genomics research and biobanking initiatives in Africa such as H3Africa have gone some way in defining aspects of fair and equitable research collaborations in Africa. However, they will},

	abstract = {Background: Political, economic and climate events continue to bring the dismantling of communities and creation of new ones. Understanding successful models of adaptation and working with communities to address their health and wellbeing needs requires ethically sound public health research. {CommunityBased} Participatory Research ({CBPR}) has been proposed as an equitable, empowering partnership approach to collaborative health research that encapsulates analysis, advocacy and action for the future wellbeing of communities. Meanwhile, a strong interest in ethical implications of {CBPR} continues in international literature, yet with a notable lack of research that captures the experience of researchers who had ethical challenges in their {CBPR} studies. The aim of this research was to address this lack of evidence by exploring those experiences of {CBPR} researchers internationally.
Methods: An innovative data collection method was designed utilising a purpose-built blog. This internet-based, qualitative online study enabled asynchronous international data collection on the blog. Participants were researchers with experience of {CBPR} and were recruited through social media platforms. Blog narratives of first-hand experiences of {CBPR} researchers were analysed using thematic analysis.
Results: The themes that emerged from blog data analysis were researchers’ challenges with balancing participant protection and autonomy, dealing with partnership tensions, and the enduring impacts on the researchers.
Conclusions: This study enhances our understanding of ethical challenges in {CBPR} with evidence of enduring impacts on researchers of the ’tightrope’ they walked in the interests of maintaining research integrity and ethical responsibility towards their partnering communities. Challenges arose largely from complexities of {CBPR} coupled with rigid regulatory structures of human research ethics review that struggles to respond adequately in the interests of communities and researchers.},

	abstract = {Background: Over the past two decades, the promotion of collaborative partnerships involving researchers from low and middle income countries with those from high income countries has been a major development in global health research. Ideally, these partnerships would lead to more equitable collaboration including the sharing of research responsibilities and rewards. While collaborative partnership initiatives have shown promise and attracted growing interest, there has been little scholarly debate regarding the fair distribution of authorship credit within these partnerships. Discussion: In this paper, we identify four key authorship issues relevant to global health research and discuss their ethical and practical implications. First, we argue that authorship guidance may not adequately apply to global health research because it requires authors to write or substantially revise the manuscript. Since most journals of international reputation in global health are written in English, this would systematically and unjustly exclude non-English speaking researchers even if they have substantially contributed to the research project. Second, current guidance on authorship order does not address or mitigate unfair practices which can occur in global health research due to power differences between researchers from high and low-middle income countries. It also provides insufficient recognition of “technical tasks” such as local participant recruitment. Third, we consider the potential for real or perceived editorial bias in medical science journals in favour of prominent western researchers, and the risk of promoting misplaced credit and/or prestige authorship. Finally, we explore how diverse cultural practices and expectations regarding authorship may create conflict between researchers from low-middle and high income countries and contribute to unethical authorship practices. To effectively deal with these issues, we suggest: 1) undertaking further empirical and conceptual research regarding authorship in global health research; 2) raising awareness on authorship issues in global health research; and 3) developing specific standards of practice that reflect relevant considerations of authorship in global health research. Summary: Through review of the bioethics and global health literatures, and examination of guidance documents on ethical authorship, we identified a set of issues regarding authorship in collaborative partnerships between researchers from low-middle income countries and high income countries. We propose several recommendations to address these concerns.},

Important approaches to recognise and undo asymmetries in concrete collaboration arrangements – division of labour, decision making, access to rewards, capacity building – have been identified.
            
              In this provocation we draw on African and other postcolonial, decolonial and feminist scholarship, as well as systems thinking and global science data to argue that such ‘equitable partnerships’ efforts at best sidestep the urgent need for a much more profound rebalancing of the positioning of Africa and ‘Global North’ in the worldwide science and research ecosystem as a whole. We consider why such wider rebalancing is an imperative for both Africa and the global community, propose that research collaborations must be understood as a key entry point for advancing such a systemic shift, and suggest a necessary
              transformative
              collaboration mode to this end. We conclude by positing an urgent need to think and act beyond ‘equitable’ partnerships and highlight where responsibilities for action must lie.},

The 7th World Conference on Research Integrity  (7WCRI) takes place in Cape Town from the 29th May 2022 to 1st June 2022. The theme of the conference is Fostering Research in an unequal world. We have proposed the Cape Town statement on Fostering Research Integrity through the promotion of fairness, equity and diversity in research collaborations and contexts as the major collaborative output for this conference. This paper serves to introduce the reader and conference attendees to the motivation and thinking behind this proposal which will be discussed further at the conference.The proposed Cape Town Statement needs to accomplish two aims. First it must clearly demonstrate why inequity and unfair practices in research collaborations and contexts is a research integrity ({RI}) matter. Second it must identify some key values or principles and action guides that will address the issue of equity and fairness in research within the context of the complete research life cycle from research agenda setting and call to proposal development, through grant application, allocation and management of funding, data production, analysis, management and sharing, to outputs, translation, and evaluation.This background paper serves to outline the rationale and justification for the proposed Cape Town Statement as a major collaborative output of the 7WCRI. It is not in itself the proposed statement but rather represents a summary of some of the thought processes and contributions thus far. We argue that the domain of {RI} and previous {WCRI} {RI} statements have focused the {RI} project primarily at a micro and meso or project level, with researchers and institutions being the main target for guidance. The Cape Town Statement project aims to widen the lens, bring in a macro perspective and ensure that other role players, including those that support global research structures and systems, are brought into focus, and encouraged to take accountability for their own spheres of influence.},

We reviewed relevant existing literature and held three workshops to present research data and holistically discuss the concept of equitable authorship and the role of academic journals in the context of international health research partnerships. We subsequently developed statements to guide prospective authors and journal editors as to how they should address this issue. We recommend that for manuscripts that report research conducted in low- or middle-income countries by collaborations including partners from one or more high-income countries, authors should submit accompanying structured reﬂexivity statements. We provide speciﬁc questions that these statements should address and suggest that journals should transparently publish reﬂexivity statements with accepted manuscripts. We also provide guidance to journal editors about how they should assess the structured statements when making decisions on whether to accept or reject submitted manuscripts. We urge journals across disciplines to adopt these recommendations to accelerate the changes needed to halt the practice of parachute research.},

Instead, development agendas of those living and working in the global South, including academics and practitioners, and those working in international non-governmental organisations should influence the research agendas, approaches, and schemes that allocate funding. These stakeholders have profound knowledge of what real-world impact looks like, the types of impact needed, local and national realities, and how complex processes of development impact unfold. Drawing on a programme of research conducted by the Rethinking Research Collaborative, we examine eight principles for ‘fair and equitable research partnerships’ using insights from our individual experiences to offer new thinking on {ODA}-funded research impact.},

              This article responds to the drive for research partnerships between academics and practitioners, arguing that while potential benefits are clear, these are frequently not actualized resulting in partnerships that are ineffectual or worse, exacerbate damaging or inequitable assumptions and practices. In order to understand/improve partnerships, a systematic analysis of the interrelationship between
              what counts as evidence
              and
              dynamics of participation
              is proposed. Drawing on data from a seminar series and iterative analysis of seven case studies of partnerships between Higher Education Institutions and International Non‐Governmental Organisations, the article concludes by suggesting substantial shifts in the theory and practice of partnerships. © 2019 The Authors Journal of International Development Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

This article draws on complexity theory and systems thinking to argue that such an assumption is problematic, divorcing collaboration from wider systems of research and practice. Instead, a systemic framework for understanding and evaluating collaboration is proposed. This framework is used to reﬂect on a set of principles for fair and equitable research collaboration that emerged from a programme of strategic research and capacity strengthening conducted by the Rethinking Research Collaborative ({RRC}) for the United Kingdom ({UK})’s primary research funder: {UK} Research and Innovation ({UKRI}). The article concludes that a systemic conceptualisation of collaboration is more responsive than a “partnership” approach, both to the principles of fairness and equity and also to uncertain futures.},

	abstract = {Fair and equitable beneﬁt-sharing’’ is one of the objectives of the {UN} Convention on Biological Diversity and the {FAO} International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. In essence, beneﬁt-sharing holds that countries, farmers, and indigenous communities that grant access to their plant genetic resources and/or traditional knowledge should share in the beneﬁts that users derive from these resources. But what exactly is understood by ‘‘fair’’ and ‘‘equitable’’ in this context? Neither term is deﬁned in the international treaties. A complicating factor, furthermore, is that different motivations and perspectives exist with respect to the notion of beneﬁt-sharing itself. This paper looks at six different approaches to beneﬁt-sharing that can be extracted from the current debates on ‘‘Access and Beneﬁt-Sharing.’’ These approaches form the basis of a philosophical reﬂection in which the different connotations of ‘‘fair and equitable’’ are considered, by analyzing the main principles of justice involved. Finally, the various principles are brought together in order to draw some conclusions as to how a fair and equitable beneﬁt-sharing mechanism might best be realized. This results in several recommendations for policymakers.},

The dynamic world environment demands continuous changes in the ways in which research organizations operate and relate to other actors in agricultural innovation systems. To date, agricultural research evaluation has been dominated by economic impact assessment frameworks and methods. Designed as research studies, impact assessments have often served accountability and public awareness purposes. However, they have been of less use to further the understanding of how policies, programs and technologies may or may not contribute to agricultural innovation. There is an increasing awareness that appropriately designed and executed evaluations—going beyond traditional economic impact assessment—can contribute substantially to institutional learning and performance improvement. This article outlines the links between evaluation, learning and institutional change, and in doing so brieﬂy summarizes the papers in this special issue of Agricultural Systems.},

The {GCRF} criteria are considered with respect to African partners’ experiences of, and aspirations from, such international research partnerships in order to enrich and extend ongoing debates about power relations in development research. The study finds that {GCRF} criteria do address many of the familiar historic concerns of African partners, while also identifying ways in which this and similar funding schemes may unintentionally reproduce structural inequities within the South.

Like these earlier programs, the major focus of the new global health programs is on the health needs of developing countries, and perhaps for this reason, few similar programs have emerged in academic institutions in the developing countries themselves. If global health is about the improvement of health worldwide, the reduction of disparities, and protection of societies against global threats that disregard national borders, it is essential that academic institutions reach across geographic, cultural, economic, gender, and linguistic boundaries to develop mutual understanding of the scope of global health and to create collaborative education and research programs. One indication of success would be emergence of a new generation of truly global leaders working on a shared and well-defined agenda – and doing so on equal footing.},

The Canadian Coalition of Global Health Research Principles for Global Health Research evolved from deep concern about the absence of standards for how Canadians engage in this ﬁeld. They can serve as a broadly relevant framework to guide how to integrate equity considerations into everyday research, knowledge translation, and practice activities. Comprised of six principles (authentic partnering, inclusion, shared beneﬁts, commitment to the future, responsiveness to causes of inequities, and humility), they are an aspirational and reﬂective frame that can elevate equity as a central procedural goal and outcome. In this commentary, we describe each of the six principles and oﬀer examples of how they are being applied to guide research practices, inform knowledge translation science and build capacity.

Theories of justice from political philosophy establish obligations for parties from high-income countries owed to parties from low and middle-income countries. We have developed a new framework that is based on Jennifer Ruger’s health capability paradigm to strengthen the link between international clinical research and justice in global health. The ‘research for health justice’ framework provides direction on three aspects of international clinical research: the research target, research capacity strengthening, and posttrial beneﬁts. It identiﬁes the obligations of justice owed by national governments, research funders, research sponsors, and investigators to trial participants and host communities. These obligations vary from those currently articulated in international research ethics guidelines. Ethical requirements of a different kind are needed if international clinical research is to advance global health equity.},

	abstract = {Objective To document clinical trial data flow in global clinical trials published in major journals between 2013 and 2021 from Global South to Global North. Design Scoping analysis
Methods We performed a search in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ({CENTRAL}) to retrieve randomised clinical trials published between 2013 and 2021 from The {BMJ}, {BMJ} Global Health, the Journal of the American Medical Association, the Lancet, Lancet Global Health and the New England Journal of Medicine. Studies were included if they involved recruitment and author affiliation across different country income groupings using World Bank definitions. The direction of data flow was extracted with a data collection tool using sites of trial recruitment as the starting point and the location of authors conducting statistical analysis as the ending point.
Results Of 1993 records initially retrieved, 517 studies underwent abstract screening, 348 studies underwent full-text screening and 305 studies were included. Funders from high-income countries were the sole funders of the majority (82\%) of clinical trials that recruited across income groupings. In 224 (73.4\%) of all assessable studies, data flowed exclusively to authors affiliated with high-income countries or to a majority of authors affiliated with high-income countries for statistical analysis. Only six (3.2\%) studies demonstrated data flow to lower middleincome countries and upper middle-income countries for analysis, with only one with data flow to a lower middleincome country.
Conclusions Global clinical trial data flow demonstrates a Global South to Global North trajectory. Policies should be re-examined to assess how data sharing across country income groupings can move towards a more equitable model.},

	abstract = {Epistemic injustice is a growing area of study for researchers and practitioners working in the field of global health. Theoretical development and empirical research on epistemic injustice are crucial for providing more nuanced understandings of the mechanisms and structures leading to the exclusion of local and marginalised groups in research and other knowledge practices. Explicit analysis of the potential role of epistemic injustice in policies and practices is currently limited with the absence of methodological starting points. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by providing a guide for individuals involved in the design and review of funding schemes wishing to conduct epistemic injustice analysis of their processes using a decolonial lens. Placing contemporary concerns in a wider historical, political and social context and building from the intertwined issues of coloniality of power, coloniality of knowledge and coloniality of being that systematically exclude non-Western epistemic groups, this practice paper presents a three-step decolonial approach for understanding the role and impact of epistemic injustices in global health research funding. It starts with an understanding of how power operates in setting the aim of a call for research proposals. Then, the influence of pose and gaze in the review process is analysed to highlight the presence of epistemological colonisation before discussing methods to address the current funding asymmetries by supporting new ways of being and doing focused on knowledge plurality. Expanding research on how epistemic wrongs manifest in global health funding practices will generate key insights needed to address underlying drivers of inequities within global health project conception and delivery.},

Infectious disease genomics are often justified by the potential they have to ameliorate Africa’s disease burden. The molecular biology revolution that preceded genomic science widened the gap between the skill sets of many African biologists and their contemporaries elsewhere. Gap closure through genomics and the application of genomic data to health problems requires participation of, and leadership from, African scientists. However, few African scientists participate in genomics, and providing biological samples is their predominant contribution. Health-related applications are emerging from genomic activity for some infectious diseases that are endemic in Africa but not for many others. This article argues that the arrival of nextgeneration diagnostics, surveillance tools, drugs and vaccines could be accelerated by improving the nature and degree of participation of African scientists in genomic and post-genomic inquiry.},

Collaboration is today the preferred framework for the mechanisms by which northern institutions support research in the south. The concept signals a shift away from the legacy of unequal (post‐) colonial power relations, although, amid persisting inequalities, the rhetorical emphasis on equality might actually hinder critical engagement with conflicts of interest and injustice. To collaborate, African scientists engage various strategies: They establish a qualified but flexible, non‐permanent workforce, diversify collaborators and research areas, source complementary funding to assemble infrastructures, and maintain prospective research populations to attract transnational clinical trials. Through this labor of collaboration, they sustain their institutions under prevailing conditions of scarcity.},

	abstract = {Background: Whilst global health research often involves international collaborations, achieving or promoting equity within collaborations remains a key challenge, despite established conceptual approaches and the development of frameworks and guidelines to promote equity. There have also been several empirical studies documenting researchers’ experiences of inequity and views on what is required to advance equity in global health collaborations. While these empirical studies provide critical insights, there has been no attempt to systematically synthetize what constitutes equity and how it can be achieved. To address this gap, we conducted a scoping review of qualitative studies, opinion and editorial pieces about what equity is and how it can be promoted in international collaborations. Methods: We conducted a scoping review to explore domains of equity in international health collaborations. This review included qualitative studies and opinion pieces or editorial pieces on equity in international health collaborations. We mapped the data and identified common themes using a thematic analysis approach. Results: This initial search retrieved a total of 7611 papers after removing duplicates. A total of 11 papers were included in this review, 10 empirical studies and 1 editorial piece. We conducted our search between October – November 2019. We identified 10 key domains which are important for promoting equity in international collaborations: funding; capacity building; authorship; sample ownership and export; trust; research agreement; acknowledging inequality; recognition and communication. Discussion: Our findings suggest that for international collaborations to be considered more equitable, it must at least consider the 10 domains we highlighted. The 10 domains map onto five key aspects of social justice theory, namely avoiding unequal power relations like subordination, group recognition and affirmation, promoting the well-being of all, inclusion in decision-making and ensuring self-development.},

	abstract = {Purpose We examine the levels of post-trial responsibility ascribed to different stakeholders, following a community-based clinical trial and how the ’responsibility’ is understood.
Methods We employed photovoice, unstructured observations and key informant interviews to gain insights into contexts of access to care following transition to the public health system post trial. We used an inductive narrative analysis to explore experiences and understandings of post-trial access ({PTA}).
Results In their photovoice stories, many participants expressed a sense of abandonment after the trial. This was viewed as a contributing factor to failing to re-engage with care available in the public health system. This led to the experiences of loss as some trial participants defaulted and died. Research investigators, department of health participants and sponsor agreed that {PTA} was especially important for communities in resource-limited settings. The government has an obligation towards its citizens while researchers have a responsibility to ensure a smooth transition of patients to public clinics. Sponsors have a responsibility to ensure that the trial is conducted in accordance with the protocol and post-trial agreements are in place and adhered to. Research partnerships among stakeholders were affected by power imbalances making it difficult to negotiate and plan for post-trial care responsibilities.
Conclusions The research community still struggles with understanding the scope of {PTA} responsibilities. Power dynamics between public health actors and research sponsors need to be managed to ensure that government involvement is not tokenistic. The responsibility of trial participants and ethics committees needs to be investigated further.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Knowledge and effective interventions exist to address many current global health inequities. However, there is limited awareness, uptake, and use of knowledge to inform action to improve the health of disadvantaged populations. The gap between knowledge and action to improve health equity is of concern to health researchers and practitioners. This study identifies and critically examines the usefulness of existing knowledge to action models or frameworks for promoting health equity.
Methods: We conducted a scoping review of existing literature to identify knowledge to action ({KTA}) models or frameworks and critiqued the models using a health equity support rubric.
Results: We identified forty-eight knowledge to action models or frameworks. Six models scored between eight and ten of a maximum 12 points on the health equity support rubric. These high scoring models or frameworks all mentioned equity-related concepts. Attention to multisectoral approaches was the factor most often lacking in the low scoring models. The concepts of knowledge brokering, integrative processes, such as those in some indigenous health research, and Ecohealth applied to {KTA} all emerged as promising areas.
Conclusions: Existing knowledge to action models or frameworks can help guide knowledge translation to support action on the social determinants of health and health equity. There is a need to further test existing models or frameworks. This process should be informed by participatory and integrative research. There is room to develop more robust equity supporting models.},

	abstract = {Background: Application of knowledge translation ({KT}) theories, models, and frameworks ({TMFs}) is one method for successfully incorporating evidence into clinical care. However, there are multiple {KT} {TMFs} and little guidance on which to select. This study sought to identify and describe available full-spectrum {KT} {TMFs} to subsequently guide users.
Methods: A scoping review was completed. Articles were identified through searches within electronic databases, previous reviews, grey literature, and consultation with {KT} experts. Search terms included combinations of {KT} terms and theory-related terms. Included citations had to describe full-spectrum {KT} {TMFs} that had been applied or tested. Titles/abstracts and full-text articles were screened independently by two investigators. Each {KT} {TMF} was described by its characteristics including name, context, key components, how it was used, primary target audience, levels of use, and study outcomes. Each {KT} {TMF} was also categorized into theoretical approaches as process models, determinant frameworks, classic theories, implementation theories, and evaluation frameworks. Within each category, {KT} {TMFs} were compared and contrasted to identify similarities and unique characteristics.
Results: Electronic searches yielded 7160 citations. Additional citations were identified from previous reviews (n = 41) and bibliographies of included full-text articles (n = 6). Thirty-six citations describing 36 full-spectrum were identified. In 24 {KT} {TMFs}, the primary target audience was multi-level including patients/public, professionals, organizational, and financial/ regulatory. The majority of the {KT} {TMFs} were used within public health, followed by research (organizational, translation, health), or in multiple contexts. Twenty-six could be used at the individual, organization, or policy levels, five at the individual/organization levels, three at the individual level only, and two at the organizational/policy level. Categorization of the {KT} {TMFs} resulted in 18 process models, eight classic theories, three determinant frameworks, three evaluation frameworks, and four that fit more than one category. There were no {KT} {TMFs} that fit the implementation theory category. Within each category, similarities and unique characteristics emerged through comparison.
Conclusions: A systematic compilation of existing full-spectrum {KT} {TMFs}, categorization into different approaches, and comparison has been provided in a user-friendly way. This list provides options for users to select from when designing {KT} projects and interventions. Trial registration: A protocol outlining the methodology of this scoping review was developed and registered with {PROSPERO} ({CRD}42018088564).},
